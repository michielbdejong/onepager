## A short introduction to 5apps

(Quick sketch, only bullet points for now)

### The Problem

* Computing becomes cheaper and more ubiquitous by the day, bringing an immense variety of platforms and devices.
* Most platforms today use proprietary development and distribution environments, forcing both users to stay on their platform, as well as developers to build apps for either only their platform or multiple platforms in parallel.
* Users don't have control over their own data most of the time. When apps store the data on their individual servers, it makes it hard for the users to use and share their data with other apps.

### The Outlook

* However, even with successful app-store models in place, most vendors are also preparing for the future by developing and adopting countless new and existing web standards to make cross-platform development and distribution feasible in the long run.
* Everybody is agreeing on the Open Web Platform (meaning HTMl5, JavaScript, and friends) to become at least an equal option for software development in the future.
* Development on those standards is going fast, as is adoption. Not only on desktop and mobile, but even on gaming consoles and TVs, with many more devices being in the offing.
* Freeing the users' data is the next step of the open web movement. Groups like Unhosted.org, that specify open storage solutions, are gaining more and more traction every day.

### Vision

* Write an app once (i.e. use only one codebase and technology set), distribute it to all possible platforms.
* Buy an app once, run it on all possible devices, no matter what operating system they run on. Never lose that app again.
* Choose where to host your data, have full control over who gets access and what you want to share.

### Solution

* Developing a service platform that makes it both easy for developers to deploy, distribute and sell their web apps, as well as for users to purchase, access, use, and backup them.
* Providing users easy discoverabiliy of apps that support open storage solutions, in conjunction with guiding developers to leverage their full potential.

A quick overview of that solution can be seen on the working drafts for our teaser pages (that are also just rough sketches, using trackpad-painted concept graphics and quick lists of what we deem important):
